# Day 17 â€” Gateway pubkey fetcher

## âœ… Shipped
- Script `scripts/fetch_pubkey.js` that queries common gateway endpoints and writes `FHE_NETWORK_PUBKEY` into `.env`.
- No new dependencies (uses Node 22 built-in fetch).

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Real encryption needs the network public key; fetching it dynamically avoids hardcoding.
- Supports multiple endpoint shapes to be gateway-agnostic.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Use the fetched key in REAL client mode to encrypt `true` and `1` for the voting demo.
