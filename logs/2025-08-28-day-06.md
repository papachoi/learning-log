# Day 6 — ConfidentialVoting demo

## 🚀 What I built
- Extended local FHE stub to support `ebool` + `FHE.select`.
- Added `ConfidentialVoting.sol` with encrypted-style branching.
- Wrote a Hardhat test that increments A/B counters via encrypted boolean flow.

## 🔑 Insights
- This mirrors Zama’s **Confidential Voting** use case described in the FHEVM whitepaper:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- Branching on encrypted conditions uses `FHE.select`, not native `if/else`.
- In real FHEVM, these are handles + coprocessor events, not plain integers.

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Try a “sealed-bid auction” demo.
- Swap stub for Zama’s real `fhevm` Solidity library.
- Experiment with `FHE.allow` + decryption oracle patterns from the whitepaper.
