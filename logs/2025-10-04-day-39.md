# Day 39 â€” Frontend Fortune Helper

## âœ… Shipped
- Added a new utility file: `frontend/src/utils/getHoroscopeMessage.js`.
- This function imports `horoscope-100.json` and returns a fortune string for any number 1â€“100.
- Keeps the frontend lightweight and consistent with the on-chain dictionary.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Now the UI can show the readable fortune instantly after receiving a numeric prediction from the contract.
- This keeps fortune logic completely off-chain, avoiding any contract size growth.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Connect this helper to the React `App.jsx` flow:
  - When a prediction (1â€“100) is returned, call `getHoroscopeMessage()` to display the fortune.
- Later, extend with language localization (Thai / English) for user variety.
