# Day 52 â€” Builder Track Submission Summary (Oct 23, 2025)

## âœ… Shipped / Progress
- Added a new **"Demo & Submission Summary"** section to the main README for the Zama Builder Track submission.
- Documented the end-to-end architecture:
  1. **User Side (Client Encryption)** â€” browser console encrypts inputs (DOB + color).
  2. **Coordinator Contract (On-Chain)** â€” stores encrypted bytes and verifies proofs.
  3. **Operator Side (Computation)** â€” decrypts, computes horoscope, re-encrypts, and submits result.
  4. **Result Decryption** â€” user decrypts final message privately.
- Embedded screenshots and steps from BASE deployment, Remix console, and event logs.
- Linked future demo video / GIF placeholders (`/docs/demo.mp4` and `/docs/demo.gif`).

## ðŸ§  Notes
- The README now explains the full cycle clearly to anyone visiting the repo.
- Included notes for:
  - Mock AES-GCM â†” future FHEVM replacement.
  - Wallet-only Remix workflow (no scripts or private keys).
  - BASE network performance results.
- Structure follows Zama Builder submission guidelines (problem â†’ architecture â†’ results â†’ future work).

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Record and embed the actual **demo video** (1â€“2 minutes) showing:
  - Encrypt â†’ Submit â†’ Compute â†’ Decrypt flow on BASE.
  - All actions via wallet confirmation pop-ups.
- Submit the GitHub link and video as final Builder Track deliverables.
