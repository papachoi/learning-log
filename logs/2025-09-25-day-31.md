# Day 31 — FHE in one minute (easy explanation)

## ✅ Shipped
- Wrote a short non-technical summary of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

## 🧠 Notes
- **The problem**: Normally, to compute on data (like adding two numbers), you must first decrypt it. This exposes the secret to whoever does the computation.
- **The idea of FHE**: With FHE, you can compute directly on *encrypted data*. The result is still encrypted, and only the owner of the secret key can decrypt it to see the real answer.
- **Why it matters**: This means you can outsource computation (to a server, blockchain, or cloud) without ever revealing your sensitive information.
- **Example**: A hospital encrypts patient data and sends it to a cloud service. The cloud runs analytics on the ciphertexts and returns encrypted results. The hospital decrypts them locally — the cloud never sees raw patient data.
- **Analogy**: Like doing math while wearing boxing gloves — you never touch the raw numbers, but when you take the gloves off (decrypt), the right answer is there.

- Turn this into a single-slide infographic for presentations.
- Write a tweet-sized version: *“FHE = compute on encrypted data. Result decrypts to the same as plaintext result. Secrets stay secret, even while in use.”*
