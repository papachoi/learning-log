# Day 29 ‚Äî FHE origin and applications

## ‚úÖ Shipped
- Researched the story of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): who invented it, why it matters, and where it‚Äôs applied today.

## üß† Notes
- **Who invented FHE**: The concept of homomorphic encryption dates back to the 1970s, but the first *fully* homomorphic scheme (supporting arbitrary computation on encrypted data) was invented by Craig Gentry in 2009 while at IBM. His lattice-based construction proved it was possible to compute anything on ciphertexts and then decrypt to the same result as if computed on plaintext.
- **Why it matters**: FHE lets data remain encrypted even while being processed. This solves the ‚Äúdata in use‚Äù problem ‚Äî normally you must decrypt before computing, which exposes secrets.
- **Modern story**: After Gentry‚Äôs breakthrough, performance was impractical (minutes per operation). Over the past decade, schemes like BGV, BFV, CKKS, and TFHE have improved speed dramatically, with libraries such as Zama‚Äôs `tfhe-rs` making FHE usable on CPUs and GPUs.
- **Applications now**:
  - Confidential token transfers and DeFi swaps: amounts and balances stay encrypted, stopping front-running.
  - Confidential voting for DAOs and governance, preventing bribery or social pressure.
  - Decentralized AI: run ML models on encrypted data, preserving user privacy.
  - Decentralized identity and KYC: age checks or compliance proofs without revealing raw data.
- **Zama‚Äôs contribution**: FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) integrates FHE into Solidity smart contracts, enabling confidential applications without changing developer workflows.
