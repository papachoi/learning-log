# Day 48 — Step 3 still blocked; plan hosting for frontend (Oct 19, 2025)

## ❗ Status
- Could not finish **Step 3 (Operator flow)** due to wallet-provider collisions in browser (multiple extensions fighting over `window.ethereum`).
- Decided to document **frontend hosting** so the UI can be shared easily once Step 3 is fixed.

## 🌐 Hosting options (picks)
1) **GitHub Pages (static)** — simple, free, great for public demo  
2) **Vercel** — one-click deploy from repo, auto previews  
3) **Netlify** — same as Vercel, easy env vars  
4) **Cloudflare Pages** — fast global CDN

## 📦 Build & env (Vite)
- Put contract address in `frontend/.env`:
  - `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...` (Sepolia/Base address)
- Build command: `npm run build` → outputs `dist/`

## ✅ GitHub Pages steps (Vite)
- If repo name is `fhe-horoscope`, set Vite base to `/fhe-horoscope/` so assets resolve correctly.
- Deploy options:
  - **GitHub Actions**: on push to `main`, auto build + publish `dist/` to Pages
  - or **gh-pages branch**: push the `dist/` subtree

## 🧰 Vercel / Netlify / CF Pages
- Framework preset: **Vite**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Add env var: `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...`

## 📝 Next
- Fix Step 3 by running in **incognito with exactly one wallet enabled** (MetaMask or Rabby).
- After Step 3 works, wire the UI button to:
  - encrypt → call contract → show fortune (using JSON mapping)
- Deploy the built UI to **GitHub Pages** first; mirror to Vercel if time permits.
