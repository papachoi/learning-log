# Day 48 — Paused on Step 3; Frontend Hosting Pending (Oct 19 2025)

## ⚙️ Status
- Still unable to resolve **Step 3 (Operator flow)** because of browser wallet conflicts and console injection issues.  
- Decided to pause debugging for the day to avoid confusion with multiple injected providers.

## 🧠 Notes
- Contract on BASE is working and visible in Remix, but full request → compute → result cycle remains incomplete.  
- Plan to resume testing in an **incognito session with only one wallet enabled** (MetaMask or Rabby).  
- Haven’t begun frontend deployment yet—will handle hosting once Step 3 runs cleanly.

## 🎯 Next
- Retry Step 3 tomorrow in a clean browser setup.  
- After confirming full workflow, deploy frontend via **GitHub Pages** or **Vercel** for public demo.
