# Day 51 ‚Äî Decrypted Final Horoscope Result & Full Workflow Complete (Oct 22 2025)

## ‚úÖ Shipped / Progress
- Successfully executed the entire Horoscope Coordinator cycle on the **BASE testnet**.
- Retrieved the encrypted result from `getEncryptedResult(id)` in Remix.
- Used `decryptFromHex()` with the original secret key in console to recover the private horoscope message locally.  
- Verified that the decrypted text matches the expected zodiac output and timestamp format from Step 3.  
- Captured screenshots of each stage (request, result, decrypt) to use in the Builder Track video.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Observations
- On-chain data remains fully opaque (bytes only) ‚Äî no personal info exposed.
- Proof hash validation now matches correctly after checking ABI encode order (bytes, uint256, uint256, bytes).
- Remix + browser console workflow is stable and repeatable on BASE.  
- Confirmed this architecture is ready for replacement with real FHEVM encryption.

## üß† Learnings
- The mock AES-GCM flow is a good placeholder to demonstrate FHE-style privacy.
- BASE RPC latency is low, making it ideal for demo purposes.
- End-to-end testing proved the concept of private horoscope prediction on a public chain.

## üéØ Next
- Compile screenshots into a 1‚Äì2 minute demo video for Zama Builder Track submission.  
- Update README with final screens + link to recording (GIF or YouTube unlisted).  
- Prepare short summary section explaining the BASE deployment and privacy mechanism.
