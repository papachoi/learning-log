# Day 37 â€” 100-number horoscope mapping

## âœ… Shipped
- Created a simple mapping for **numbers 1â€“100 â†’ short fortunes** and saved it as:
  - `fhe-horoscope/data/horoscope-100.csv`
- Messages cycle through: win, luck, love, wealth, health, learn, travel, create, connect, focus.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- This mapping matches the contractâ€™s current dictionary, so the UI can render a readable fortune from the numeric result.
- Keeping it as a CSV makes it easy to load from the frontend or scripts without touching the contract.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Wire the frontend to:
  - call the contract,
  - read the numeric result (1..100),
  - map it to a fortune via `horoscope-100.csv`.
- When moving to real FHEVM, keep the same mapping so the UI remains unchanged while inputs become private.
