# Day 41 — Auto-clear Old Predictions

## ✅ Shipped
- Updated the frontend (`App.jsx`) to **clear previous fortune results** whenever a new prediction request starts.
- Prevents confusion between old and new results.
- Keeps the UI smoother and more responsive during MetaMask transactions.

## 🧠 Notes
- This small UX fix ensures the display always matches the latest confirmed transaction.
- A simple detail, but improves the “live feeling” of the dApp.

## 🎯 Next
- Add a lightweight **loading indicator** while waiting for the next prediction.
- Later, integrate encryption feedback (e.g., “Encrypting inputs…” before sending).
