# Day 34 â€” Joined Zama Protocol Developer Program ðŸŽ‰

## âœ… Shipped
- Officially got the role in the **Zama Protocol Developer Program**.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- The program has two tracks:
  - **Builder Track**  
    - Deliver a functioning dApp demo using Zama Protocol.  
    - Must include both **smart contract + frontend**.  
    - Clear documentation is required (demo video optional but recommended).  
  - **Bounty Track**  
    - Follow specific bounty requirements posted on zama.ai/programs/developer-program.  
    - Usually smaller, focused tasks that align with Zamaâ€™s roadmap.

- My current position: I already have contract demos (encrypted counter, confidential voting, auction). These can serve as the backbone for a **Builder Track project**.
- I can also pick up **Bounty Track tasks** if they overlap with what Iâ€™m already exploring.

## ðŸŽ¯ Plan (still thinking)
- Leaning towards the **Builder Track**:  
  - Idea: *Confidential Governance dApp* (voting + proposals with encrypted tallies).  
  - Contracts are mostly ready â†’ next step is building a **minimal frontend**.  
  - Add docs + a short demo video.  
- Keep an eye on **bounties** as they appear â€” could complement Builder work.

## ðŸ’­ Reflection
- Excited to be part of the program.  
- This log marks the start of a structured journey with Zama â†’ from small demos to a polished confidential dApp.
