# Day 46 â€” Remix-Only Wallet Flow Integration (Oct 15 2025)

## âœ… Shipped
- Added **HoroscopeCoordinator.sol** smart contract for an off-chain/coordination workflow.
- Created **docs/REMIX_PLAYBOOK.md** explaining how to deploy and interact fully via **Remix + Rabby/MetaMask**, no `.env` or private-key files.
- Added **scripts/console/crypto-helpers.js** â€” clean async AES-GCM mock-FHE + `keccakPackedHex()` helpers for encryption/decryption and proof generation directly in the browser console.
- Linked the playbook inside the main README for easy discovery.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- The Remix-only flow is **100 % wallet-based** and safer for demos.
- Every step (deploy, submitRequest, submitResult, getEncryptedResult) happens through wallet pop-ups â€” no local secrets.
- Inputs and results appear as encrypted bytes on-chain â†’ demonstrates the FHE privacy pattern even without the full SDK.
- The flow mimics real FHEVM interactions: client encrypts â†’ coordinator stores â†’ operator computes â†’ client decrypts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Replace AES-GCM mock with **real Zama FHEVM client SDK** once available.
- Record a **Remix walkthrough video** for Builder Track submission.
