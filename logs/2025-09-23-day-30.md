# Day 30 ‚Äî FHE vs ZK vs MPC vs TEEs

## ‚úÖ Shipped
- Compared four major privacy-preserving computation paradigms: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZK), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

## üß† Notes

| Tech | What it does | Strengths | Weaknesses | Example use cases |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **FHE** (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) | Compute on encrypted data; decrypt result = same as plaintext result | Data never leaves ciphertext, strongest confidentiality, supports arbitrary functions | Computationally heavy (though improving), ciphertexts large | Confidential smart contracts (Zama FHEVM), encrypted ML inference |
| **ZK** (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) | Prove a statement/computation is correct without revealing inputs | Efficient verification, great for scalability, widely used in blockchains | Doesn‚Äôt hide data during processing, sometimes needs trusted setup | zkRollups, anonymous credentials, verifiable on-chain computation |
| **MPC** (Multi-Party Computation) | Secret shared across multiple parties; compute jointly without revealing | Distributes trust, no single party learns data, efficient for some operations | Needs multiple honest parties online, high communication overhead | Joint auctions, private set intersection, collaborative analytics |
| **TEEs** (Trusted Execution Environments) | Isolated enclave in hardware executes computation securely | Near-native performance, easy developer toolchains | Trust placed in hardware vendor, vulnerable to side-channel attacks | Cloud confidential computing, off-chain blockchain oracles |

**Takeaway**  
- FHE ‚Üí confidentiality for data-in-use  
- ZK ‚Üí verifiable correctness  
- MPC ‚Üí trust spread across parties  
- TEEs ‚Üí fast hardware isolation  

In practice, modern systems often **combine them** (e.g., FHE for private processing + ZK to prove correctness).
