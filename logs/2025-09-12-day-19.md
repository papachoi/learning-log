# Day 19 â€” Reflection (short)

## âœ… Shipped
- No new code today; focused on review & consolidation.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Stubbed FHE library let me practice the *shape* of encrypted contracts.
- Real TFHE library enforces proper encrypted ops (no unwraps, must use `TFHE.select`).
- Key insight: designing for encrypted flow is different â€” logic must be expressed as arithmetic + mux, not conditionals.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Day 20: try a minimal REAL-mode test call (encrypted `true` + `1`) with pubkey.
