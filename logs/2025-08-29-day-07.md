# Day 7 — SealedBidAuction demo

## 🚀 What I built
- Extended the local FHE stub by adding `gt(a,b)` (greater-than comparator).  
- Implemented `SealedBidAuction.sol`: a simple contract where users place “encrypted” bids (`euint64`).  
- Used `FHE.gt` + `FHE.select` to update the **highest bid** and **winner** without using plain `if/else`.  
- Wrote a test with 3 bidders; confirmed correct winner and that no bids are accepted after the auction is closed.

## 🧩 How it works (for beginners)
1. **Stub library (`FHE.sol`)**  
   - We don’t have real FHE yet, so we fake it with Solidity types:  
     ```solidity
     type euint64 is uint64;
     type ebool is bool;
     ```  
   - `gt(a,b)` returns an `ebool`.  
   - `select(cond, x, y)` returns `x` if `cond` is true, otherwise `y`.  
   - This mimics how the real FHE library would let us “branch” on encrypted values:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

2. **Contract logic**  
   - When someone calls `bid(amount)`:
     - Store their bid.
     - Compare it to the current `highest`.
     - If it’s higher, update both `highest` and `winner`.
   - We do this with:
     ```solidity
     ebool isGreater = FHE.gt(amount, highest);
     highest = FHE.select(isGreater, amount, highest);
     if (ebool.unwrap(isGreater)) {
         winner = msg.sender;
     }
     ```
   - Notice: `highest` is updated with `select`, not with a normal `if`. This is how FHE avoids revealing values.

3. **Closing the auction**  
   - Anyone can call `close()`.  
   - After that, new bids are rejected with `"auction closed"`.  

4. **Testing it**  
   - 3 bidders place bids: `3, 5, 4`.  
   - Highest = `5`, Winner = bidder #2.  
   - After `close()`, no new bids are allowed.  
   - All tests passed ✅.  

## 🔑 Insights
- In the real FHEVM:  
  - Each bid would be an actual ciphertext.  
  - The comparison (`gt`) would run offchain in a **coprocessor**.  
  - Only the final result (winner + highest) is revealed.  
- This mirrors Zama’s **sealed-bid auction** use case:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}, where all bids stay private until the auction ends.

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Add **commit–reveal** style bidding (hashes + salts) for when FHE isn’t available.  
- Try swapping the stub with the actual Zama `fhevm` Solidity library.  
- Explore connecting to a testnet with a gateway + oracle to decrypt the winner onchain.
