# Day 24 â€” With code

## âœ… Shipped
- Added a Hardhat test `test/confidentialAdder.js`.
- Deploys `ConfidentialAdder` and calls `addEncrypted(5,7)` with placeholder values.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Even without ciphertexts, tests confirm contracts deploy + tx shape works.
- Good scaffold for plugging in REAL-mode encrypted inputs later.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Expand tests to cover ConfidentialVotingTFHE and assert tx success.
