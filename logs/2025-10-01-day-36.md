# Day 36 â€” FHEVM-Ready Horoscope Prototype

## âœ… Shipped
- Added new contract `PrivateHoroscopeFHE.sol` for use on an **FHEVM-compatible network**.
- Accepts **encrypted DOB and favorite color** as `externalEuint64` with attestations.
- Uses FHE homomorphic operations (`add`, `rem`) to compute a result in range 1..100.
- Requests decryption via an oracle and handles the callback with signature verification.
- Emits `Predicted(reqId)` when a request is sent and `Revealed(value, sig)` on oracle response.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- This design solves the privacy gap of v1: raw inputs will no longer appear in transaction calldata.
- Still a prototype: requires client SDK integration to encrypt inputs and a real FHEVM oracle setup.
- Next step is frontend wiring: encrypt inputs in browser â†’ send ciphertexts â†’ display decrypted prediction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Update Vite/React frontend to use the FHE client SDK.
- Test on an actual FHEVM testnet once available.
- Keep the old v1 contract live on Sepolia for comparison demo.
