# Day 13 â€” Client & Network Prep

## âœ… Shipped
- Added `.env.example` and wired Hardhat for localhost + Sepolia.
- Wrote deploy script for `ConfidentialVotingTFHE`.
- Added `vote_scaffold.js` to show how the client will call `vote(ebool, euint64)`.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- TFHE contracts expect encrypted inputs; placeholder values are for scaffolding only.
- Next step is integrating the client SDK to produce encrypted ebool/uint64 and (optionally) reading tallies via gateway.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Plug in fhEVM client SDK to encrypt `true` and `1` for a real vote on localhost.
- Try a minimal UI (Next.js) to call vote and display (post-decryption) results.
