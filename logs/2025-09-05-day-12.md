# Day 12 â€” TFHE-native voting & auction (compile-only)

## âœ… Shipped
- `ConfidentialVotingTFHE.sol`: A/B votes with encrypted branching via `TFHE.select`.
- `SealedBidAuctionTFHE.sol`: encrypted `highest` using `TFHE.gt` + `TFHE.select`.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- No `unwrap` allowed for encrypted types; all control flow must use `select`.
- Returning encrypted values (`euint64`) is fine; decryption occurs via client/gateway.
- Runtime tests need a client that encrypts inputs and triggers the gateway.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Add a tiny client script to encrypt a `1` for voting and call `vote(...)`.
- Explore a winner resolution pattern without plaintext unwraps.
