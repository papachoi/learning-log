# Day 45 — Fortune Legend Tooltip (Oct 14, 2025)

## ✅ Shipped
- Added a new `FortuneLegend.jsx` component displaying all fortune types with emoji and color.
- Integrated it into the main UI under the result card for quick reference.

## 🧠 Notes
- The legend helps new users understand the meaning of each fortune icon.
- Simple inline styles keep the layout lightweight; can later migrate to a tooltip library if needed.

## 🎯 Next
- Add a small “copy fortune” button for easy sharing.
- Prepare screenshot/GIF for final Builder Track submission.
