# Day 49 â€” Plan to Retry Step 3 Debug Session (Oct 20, 2025)

## ðŸ§© Context
- Step 3 (Operator flow) is still unresolved due to wallet-provider collisions and console access errors in Remix.
- The HoroscopeCoordinator contract remains successfully deployed on the BASE testnet.
- Today's focus was to prepare a clean environment and step plan for the next attempt.

## ðŸ§  Debug Plan
1. **Clean Browser Setup**
   - Use a fresh Incognito session with **only one wallet extension enabled** (MetaMask *or* Rabby).
   - Ensure Remix is connected to the same network (BASE).
2. **Re-import Helpers**
   - Paste `crypto-helpers.js` in the console.
   - Use fresh timestamp and block number (from `eth_blockNumber` or public RPC).
3. **Execute Operator Flow**
   - Decrypt previous encrypted BD.
   - Compute zodiac + horoscope.
   - Re-encrypt result and compute keccak proof.
   - Submit via `submitResult()` in Remix â†’ verify `ResultVerified` event.
4. **Verification**
   - Call `getEncryptedResult(id)` and decrypt final message locally.
   - Document full console logs + screenshots.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Finish and confirm the full private horoscope cycle on BASE.
- Once successful, move on to **frontend integration + deployment** on GitHub Pages.
