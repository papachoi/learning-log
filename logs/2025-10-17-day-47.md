# Day 47 — Deployed HoroscopeCoordinator on BASE & Debugging Step 3 (Oct 17, 2025)

## ✅ Shipped
- Successfully deployed **HoroscopeCoordinator.sol** on the **BASE testnet** — first deployment outside Sepolia.
- Verified the contract address and confirmed all functions (`submitRequest`, `submitResult`, `getEncryptedResult`) are visible in Remix.
- Began running **Step 3 (Operator flow)** of the wallet-only process to encrypt, compute, and submit results.

## 🧠 Notes
- Hit wallet-provider conflicts in browser console:
  - Error: *“Cannot redefine property: ethereum”* — caused by multiple wallet extensions (MetaMask, Rabby, Auro, Zerion, Sender, etc.) injecting providers.
  - Remix couldn’t access `window.ethereum` properly for reading block number or sending requests.
- Found workaround: fetch block data from a public BASE RPC or isolate one wallet provider in an **Incognito window**.
- Learned that a clean environment (one wallet, one network) is crucial when running Remix + FHE console demos.

## 🎯 Next
- Retry **Step 3 (Operator flow)** after disabling extra wallets.
- Continue from decrypt → compute → encrypt → submitResult → verify event.
- Prepare screen capture once the full BASE flow completes for Builder Track submission.
