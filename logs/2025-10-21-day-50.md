# Day 50 ‚Äî Retrying Step 3 on BASE with Clean Environment (Oct 21, 2025)

## ‚úÖ Shipped / Progress
- Launched a **fresh incognito browser session** with only one wallet active (MetaMask disguised as Rabby).
- Reloaded Remix, connected to the **BASE testnet**, and re-imported helper script `crypto-helpers.js`.
- Successfully fetched new block number and timestamp directly from RPC.
- Re-executed Operator Flow commands:
  - Decrypted BD locally in console.
  - Generated zodiac and horoscope message.
  - Re-encrypted result and produced keccak proof.
- Submitted `submitResult()` transaction in Remix.
- Monitored `ResultVerified` event; confirmed partial success (tx mined).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Observations
- Transaction executes but sometimes proof validation mismatch occurs ‚Üí likely byte-encoding issue between JS `AbiCoder` and Remix‚Äôs encoding.
- AES-GCM mock remains deterministic, which is fine for demo; real FHE inputs will use randomized IVs.
- On-chain logs verify end-to-end structure works (request ‚Üí result), proving architecture correctness.

## üß† Learnings
- Keeping one wallet provider eliminates all `window.ethereum` injection errors.
- Remix + browser console is powerful enough for full off-chain FHE simulation.
- BASE testnet is stable and responsive for privacy-demo transactions.

## üéØ Next
- Fix proof mismatch by verifying packed argument order in `keccakPackedHex`.
- Once consistent, retrieve and decrypt final horoscope result for recording.
- Prepare short walkthrough video or GIF for Builder Track submission.
