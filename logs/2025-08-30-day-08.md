# Day 8 â€” ConfidentialMultiplier

## âœ… Shipped
- Added `ConfidentialMultiplier.sol` + test.
- First step towards modeling FHEVM arithmetic with stubbed types.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- Even simple multiply shows how encrypted arithmetic can be composed.
- Next: combine add + mul into a small pipeline.
