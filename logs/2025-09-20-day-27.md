# Day 27 â€” Mock oracle decrypt callback

## âœ… Shipped
- Added `CounterDecryptDemo.sol` to request a decryption and handle callbacks.
- Added `MockDecryptionOracle.sol` that instantly calls back with a chosen plaintext.
- Wrote `day27_oracle_mock.js` test to run the full request â†’ oracle â†’ callback flow.
- Committed contracts to `fhevm-playground` repo.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Compilation errors with `handles` scope reminded me to simplify variable naming and check for duplicate `.sol` files.
- In the live FHEVM stack, decryptions are handled by Gateway + KMS with signed results, but here a mock oracle simulates the callback without signatures.
- This matches the flow described in docs: contract requests decryption, oracle forwards to Gateway/KMS, callback receives signed plaintexts.
- Even though my current Hardhat compile still shows identifier errors, the log and commit capture the scaffold for later debugging.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Debug the undeclared identifier issue (check duplicate files, Hardhat paths, or typos).
- Add signature verification stub so callbacks require KMS-style signatures.
- Eventually replace the mock with a real FHEVM Gateway/Oracle once infrastructure is available.
