# Day 25 — Minimal FHE example with code

## ✅ Shipped
- `ConfidentialCounter.sol`: stores an encrypted `euint64` counter.
- `inc(euint64 delta)`: increments using an encrypted handle (proper FHE-style).
- `incPlain(uint64 delta)`: helper for local dev; contract calls `FHE.asEuint64` internally.
- Test `confidentialCounter.js` runs increments and prints the encrypted handle.

## 🧠 What this shows
- How to keep contract state encrypted (`euint64`), update it (`FHE.add`), and manage access with `FHE.allow` / `FHE.allowTransient`.
- How to surface the encrypted handle to clients for later decryption (user/public).

## 🎯 Next
- Wire a decryption oracle in dev (mock/stub or Zama’s hosted) and verify callback signatures.
- Try bridging a handle across “chains” (via Gateway) and calling a second contract.
