# Day 35 — Private FHE Horoscope dApp

## ✅ Shipped
- Finalized and deployed `FHEHoroscope.sol` on **Sepolia**  
  - [0x73b2e2ca35c52d4446e7a39b22ff8f0df8ad7d05](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x73b2e2ca35c52d4446e7a39b22ff8f0df8ad7d05)
- Contract features:
  - Accepts DOB (yyyymmdd) and favorite color (hex string).
  - Pseudo-encrypts with keccak256 (FHE-ready structure).
  - Combines with `block.timestamp` and user address for variety.
  - Produces output in range **1–100**.
  - Dictionary maps each number to a fortune (e.g. win, luck, love, wealth…).
  - Emits both numeric index and fortune message via `Predicted` event.
- Preserved backwards compatibility with `makeVec` and `predictHoroscope` for earlier tests/UI.

## 🧠 Notes
- Solidity can’t access wall-clock, so `block.timestamp` serves as “current date”.
- Dictionary is compact: 10 messages repeated over 100 numbers (gas-efficient).
- Verification on Etherscan requires exact compiler + optimizer settings (will redo with Standard JSON input to succeed).
- This is **the first version**: inputs (`dobYmd`, `favoriteColor`) are still visible in the transaction call data.  
  - Next milestone: integrate real FHE so inputs are hidden (encrypted client-side and processed securely on-chain).
- Prototype keeps the **FHEVector** type as a placeholder, so migrating to Zama FHEVM later will be straightforward.

## 🎯 Next
- Add a `deployments/sepolia.json` file to track addresses for frontend auto-load.
- Build Vite/React frontend that takes DOB + color → shows decrypted fortune.
- Try Etherscan “Standard JSON input” verification with exact Remix settings.
- Explore Zama FHEVM SDK to replace hash-based pseudo-encryption and protect user inputs.
- Record demo video for Builder Track submission.
