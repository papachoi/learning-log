# Day 42 — Loading Indicator for Predictions

## ✅ Shipped
- Added a lightweight **loading indicator** to the frontend (`App.js`).
- Displays “🔮 Calculating your fortune…” while waiting for transaction confirmation.
- Button text changes to “Processing…” and disables clicks until complete.

## 🧠 Notes
- Improves user feedback and makes the dApp feel more responsive.
- Still simple inline styling — can later replace with an animated spinner.

## 🎯 Next
- Add a small fade-in animation for the fortune card once the prediction appears.
- Begin drafting README section for the frontend usage.
