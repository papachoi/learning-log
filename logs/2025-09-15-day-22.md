# Day 22 â€” Easy mode

## âœ… Shipped
- Quick note from the FHEVM whitepaper.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- FHEVM uses **threshold key management (KMS)** so no single party holds the decryption key.
- This design reduces trust assumptions: security comes from distributed key shares.
- Fits well for confidential DeFi and governance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next
- Day 23: jot down another concept (e.g. ZK proofs role) or test decrypt flow.
