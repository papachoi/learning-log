# Day 32 — Confidential voting with FHEVM + Gentry 2009 paper summary

## ✅ Shipped
- Built `ConfidentialVotingDemo.sol` with encrypted tally + mock oracle (local demo).
- Summarized Craig Gentry’s 2009 paper *“Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices”*.
- Added a quick timeline of FHE milestones.

## 🧠 Notes
- **Gentry 2009 core idea**: first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) construction; introduced **bootstrapping** (evaluate decryption under encryption to refresh noise) enabling arbitrary computation on ciphertexts.
- **Construction sketch**: (1) somewhat homomorphic scheme over **ideal lattices** → (2) **squash** decryption to a shallow circuit → (3) **bootstrap** to support unbounded depth.
- **Why it matters**: compute on encrypted data without exposing plaintext (solves “data in use” privacy). Seeds modern apps in cloud, AI, and blockchains.

## 📊 Timeline of FHE (high level)
```text
1978 — Rivest, Adleman, Dertouzos
        "privacy homomorphisms" proposed (insecure in practice)

2005–2008 — Partial homomorphic schemes
        Addition-only / multiplication-only (not fully homomorphic)

2009 — Craig Gentry (STOC)
        First full FHE via ideal lattices + bootstrapping

2010s — Faster schemes & libraries
        BGV, BFV, CKKS, TFHE; HElib, SEAL, PALISADE

2020s — Practical deployments
        Zama’s tfhe-rs & FHEVM, industry pilots (confidential AI, voting, KYC)
