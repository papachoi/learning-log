# Day 43 — Fade-in Animation for Fortune Result

## ✅ Shipped
- Added a smooth **fade-in animation** to the fortune result card (`FortuneResult.jsx`).
- Card now transitions from slight offset & opacity 0 → visible in 0.6 s.
- Makes the fortune reveal feel more “magical” and polished.

## 🧠 Notes
- Tiny UX detail but adds delight to each prediction.
- Implemented with simple inline CSS transitions (no extra libraries).

## 🎯 Next
- Add optional emoji or color highlight per fortune type.
- Prepare short GIF/video clip to show frontend interactions for Builder Track submission.
